# GPT Workshop Starter Code
Hello and welcome! In this repo you will be able to find the starter (and completed) code for the [GPT Workshop](https://lu.ma/gpt-workshop).

To get started, please fork the repo using the button in the top right corner. Once you have your own copy of it you will need to clone the repo so that you can edit the code on your local machine.

I have made videos with instructions for walking you through the entire process of completing the workshop. From setting up your [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) account to deploying your assistant application with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). They can be found in the `tutorial` folder. I recommend that you watch them in order as you progress through the workshop.

## Couple things to note:
- The front-end used for this workshop is forked from [Chatbot-UI](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui) written by [McKay Wrigley](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/). Feel free to show him some support!
- A working implementation of the finished product can be found and tested at [this](https://gpt-workshop.vercel.app/) link. Feel free to try it out yourself
- This repo was created to facilitate a live workshop that happened on December 21th 2023, but you should be able to complete it asynchronously using the recorded videos. If you have any questions about what to do please feel free to ping me on Twitter [@_broskitweets](https://twitter.com/_broskitweets)

## That's it
That's all from me for now. For any other inquiries ping me on twitter [@_broskitweets](https://twitter.com/_broskitweets).

Hope you enjoy the workshop! Good luck, have fun :)
